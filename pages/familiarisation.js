<p>5 most favourite:</p>
<p>1.Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer&#39;s broken project - I love troubleshooting and analysis<br></br>2.Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use - Finding one or two issues that are negatively impacting 
confidence of a number of clients in our offering is always very helpful as most of the times they are like low hanging fruits with very high ROI.<br></br>3.Find and recruit teammates for the support team - Having the right ppl on onboard is extremely critical to the success of any organization/team. I've been doing this for a long and would like to continue doing so.
