confidence of a number of clients in our offering is always very helpful as most of the times they are like low hanging fruits with very high ROI.<br></br>3.Find and recruit teammates for the support team - Having the right ppl on onboard is extremely critical to the success of any organization. I've been doing this for a long and would like to continue doing so.<br></br>.4.Help train and onboard new support teammates - This does not only help team/organization but also creates a bond between teammates which is very helpful when it comes to &#39;one team one dream&#39;<br></br>.</p>
