<h1>Answer #1</h1>
<p>5 Most Favourite:</p>
<p>1.Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer&#39;s broken project - I love troubleshooting and analysis<br></br>2.Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use - Finding one or two issues that are negatively impacting 
confidence of a number of clients in our offering is always very helpful as most of the times they are like low hanging fruits with very high ROI.<br></br>3.Find and recruit teammates for the support team - Having the right ppl on onboard is extremely critical to the success of any organization/team. I&#39;ve been doing this for a long and would like to continue doing so.
<br></br>4.Help train and onboard new support teammates - This does not only help team/organization but also creates a bond between teammates which is very helpful when it comes to &#39;one team one dream&#39; <br></br>5.Work with people to figure out if Vercel is suitable for their use case - Client use case is where it all starts + knowing the client&#39;s use case always helps in understanding how they are using our offerings.</p>
<p>5 Least Favourite:</p>
<p>1.Manage a support team- I am happy to lead a team but managing a team is responsibility that I&#39;d like to avoid as at times managers struggle to be hundred percent transparent with the team. I&#39;d be happy to manage a team for a shorter time while we are waiting manager&#39;s position to be closed.<br></br>2.
Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and other 3rd party sites - Something I&#39;dlike to avoid for now as my written communication is not up to mark to represent an organization at platform
where my comments would be read by tens of thousands of people.</p>

<h1>Answer #2</h1>
<p>Happy to do all the nineteen things listed in Question #1 except managing a team. Beside those, I&#39;d like to learn coding and internals of Node, React and Next.js</p>
  
<h1>Answer #3</h1>
<p>When I started my journey at Precisely (then Pitney Bowes), I used to support a product that was very widely used on Windows. The team was relatively new and since troubleshooting client cases/tickets was our primary task it was not going very well as we were unaware of tools that can present a complete picture of what is happening under the hood even when we were able to replicate the client&#39;s problem locally (It was the time when SAAS and Cloud were just emerging so all the clients were using our offering on-premises). While researching on a possible root cause
of a problem, I came across Sysinternals tools (now part Microsoft), and just after going through their website for 10-20 minutes, I knew this is going to change our 
(I & my team&#39;s) lives completely and I was right. Click <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/" rel="noreferrer"><u>here</u></a> to go to Sysinternals home page.</p>

<h1>Answer #5</h1>
<p>If we have a support KB article already created for an issue/question, I&#39;d prefer to send the URL of the same instead of writing steps on my own. This is what I&#39;d write to the client.<br></br>

Hello xyz,
<p>Greetings and thank you for contacting Vercel Support. Follow these steps:<br></br>
1) Go to Vercel project in which you want to use domain purchased at &#39;GoDaddy&#39;.<br></br>
2) Go to &#39;Domains&#39; in Project &#39;Settings&#39; and click &#39;Add&#39; after giving the domain to be added. <br></br>
3) One you click &#39;Add&#39;, you may be given recommendation on redirection in &#39;Add Domain&#39; window. <br></br>
4) &#39;Invalid configuration&#39; would be observed under the added domain until DNS record is added on the GoDaddy. With the invalid configuration, you&#39;ll get recommended record type, name and value. <br></br>
5) Go to GoDaddy Domain Control Center. Under DNS management, add the record type, name & Value. <br></br></p>

<p>You may have to add multiple records, depending on the domain name. This change may take between few minutes to few hours to take effect. Once it takes effect, you will not see &#39;Invalid configuration&#39;.</p>
